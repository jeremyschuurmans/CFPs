# Mise en Place for Developers

## Abstract

For chefs, mise en place, meaning “everything in its place”, is both a workflow designed to maximize organization and efficiency, and a way of life that has, at its core, the mentality of always being prepared for the unexpected. In this talk, we will study how chefs approach their craft, and apply what we learn directly to our own craft.

## Objectives:

To define specific aspects of mise en place that allow chefs to perform well under pressure and in spite of setbacks.
To apply these principles to programming, and understand how they can help developers perform well under pressure, in spite of numerous bugs and other setbacks.

## Pitch:

Cooking, like programming, is a craft that involves a highly specialized body of knowledge, and the ability to function well under pressure and deadlines. Chefs have developed specific, battle-tested principles that help them perform at their best, and these concepts apply just as well to programming. Having been both a chef and a programmer, I would love to share the concept of mise en place with the community.

## Speaker Information:

Jeremy started out flipping burgers in a dive bar before working his way into the northwest fine-dining scene. Along the way, he decided to learn Ruby. Lately, when he’s not hanging out with his partner in crime and two little boys, he’s trying to become as good a programmer as he was a chef, and help others along the way.
