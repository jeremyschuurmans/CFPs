# Mise en Place for Developers

## Abstract

For chefs, mise en place, meaning “everything in its place”, is both a workflow designed to maximize organization and efficiency, and a way of life that has, at its core, the mentality of always being prepared for the unexpected. In this talk, we will study how chefs approach their craft, and apply what we learn directly to our own craft.

## Objectives:

To define specific aspects of mise en place that allow chefs to perform well under pressure and in spite of setbacks.
To apply these principles to programming, and understand how they can help developers perform well under pressure, in spite of numerous bugs and other setbacks.

## Outline:

1. **Intro**
   - About me
2. **What is mise en place?**
   - Define it (Anthony Bourdain quote)
   - Why does it matter to chefs?
        - Organization/strategy/plan
        - Aids in problem solving
   - Why should programmers care?
	 - Organization/strategy/plan
	 - Aids in problem solving
3. **Chefs vs. programmers**
    - Similar specialization in skills
    - Similar team-oriented work environment
    - Similar focus on the user/customer
    - Similar need to problem solve
4. **Mise en place for programmers**
   - The Prep List: never work without it
      - Write it the day before
      - Make it thorough
      - Plan ahead (what can you do today to make tomorrow easier?)
	  - Don't be afraid to ask for help (teammates/Slack)
   - Gather your ingredients before you start.
	   - Pseudocode
	   - Map out projects/work/challenges so you have a clear understanding of the steps you need to take to make it happen
	   - Programs are built like recipes, one piece at a time until you have a finished product
   - Clean Work Station = Clean Mind
     - The more organized you are, the more effective you are
       - This holds true for your physical environment and especially your virtual environment (your computer desktop, your file organization, clean code)
	 - When you get in the weeds, the first thing to do is get organized
		  - Close some of the million tabs you have open in your browser and text editor
		   - Get up, and toss some trash you may have sitting on your desk
		   - Take a walk. The act of organizing and doing something different helps clear your mind and ease anxiety
	- It's a personal thing. Everyone's mise is different.
5. **Conclusion**

Use personal examples from the kitchen and programming whenever possible.

## Pitch:

Cooking, like programming, is a craft that involves a highly specialized body of knowledge, and the ability to function well under pressure and deadlines. Chefs have developed specific, battle-tested principles that help them perform at their best, and these concepts apply just as well to programming. Having been both a chef and a programmer, I would love to share the concept of mise en place with the community.

## Speaker Information:

Jeremy started out flipping burgers in a dive bar before working his way into the northwest fine-dining scene. Along the way, he decided to learn Ruby. Lately, when he’s not hanging out with his partner in crime and two little boys, he’s trying to become as good a programmer as he was a chef, and help others along the way.
